### General Performance-Consideration Approaches Applied

1. Limitting Component Abstractions
2. Apply Lazy-loading to FCP Bundle size
3. Optimise Event Handling using Modifiers
4. Optimise Media Assets
5. Implement Server Side Rendering (SSR)
6. Check the Core Web Vitals

## Adding Unit, Integration, Functional | Feature, and E2E Test Capabilities

Apart from using Vitest for entry-level testing, additional Test capabilities using Playwright's & Cypress' Platforms will be added as the template gets expanded with sample standard best-practise methods and features.

The intent is to add Acceptance and performance Testing Functionality entry-points as well. These tests should obviously expand to include API testing from a Frontend Framework's prespective as well.

This will also roll-over into a formal CI/CD pipeline getting added using Git-based workflows supported by a local Jenkins configuration.

## Adding Generic Forms and UI Components

Generic Forms, Components and other standard-use Design Elements will be added as this template gets expanded.

The aim is to provide a low-friction entry-point for easily adding popular Vue and Nuxt UI frameworks as a particular preference or requirement.

Tailwind CSS supported by PostCSS is built in, and configured to catering for cases where Sass CSS, Less, or vanilla CSS classes might be needed.

## Autentication, Authorization & Encryption Foundations

The template will be pre-configured to apply foundational security principles. Apart from the obvious Auth processes and access management considered a minimum "must-have" demonstrated by [Vue Authenticate](https://github.com/dgrubelic/vue-authenticate), and [Nuxt Auth Utils](https://github.com/atinux/nuxt-auth-utils), the template caters for a best-practise approach to HTTP2/3 secure header employment by building on good [CSP practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), as well.

To cater for the evolution in Authentication technologies [Cerbos's JS SDK](https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos-sdk-javascript) and Auth Policy PDP approaches are included. These base-line Auth Policies will enable easy secure integration with REST and GraphQL APIs which might be employed by the Vue SPA only or when combined with a Backend framework of choice.

As a final part security related, the template will be adapted to include interfacing with Rust-based Web Assembly Modules for high quality Encryption | Decryption technology, aimed at surpassing the NIST standards.
Options currently considered to achieve these goals are from [Avarok Cybersecurity](https://github.com/Avarok-Cybersecurity) and [Terra Quantum](https://github.com/terra-quantum-public).

## SEO and SERP Foundations

Depending on how a Vue Application is configured to run, either as SSR or Client-based, SEO and the required SERP results still remain a crucial Business focuspoint. The template allows for employing both static and dynamic Metadata management. Some example guidelines were gained from [Vue Meta](https://github.com/nuxt/vue-meta/tree/next).
